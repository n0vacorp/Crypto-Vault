# Crypto Vault v1.0.0

Crypto Vault is a program meant to manipulate the blockchain by sending coins then revoking them right before they reach a confirmaiton
This results in the coins becoming duplicated which is why Crypto Vault is able to distribute fake or "flashed" coins accross the network

# How To Use
- `git clone https://github.com/n0vacorp/Crypto-Vault`
- `cd Crypto-Vault`
- unzip the folder
- `main.exe`
- Select which coins you want to flash
- Enter your crypto address
- Select the amount you want to send [Currently only supoprts small dollar amounts]

# More Info
- Crypto Vault is free for now, but soon may become paid, so be aware of this.
- Crypto Vault is still in **early development** so expect bugs or other problems to occur.
- If you get any errors please take the time to create an issue and we will try to fix it.
- Crypto Vault is not open source because it would make it easy for it to be patched, we do not want others copying our code and selling our work.
- Crypto Vault is still actively recieving updates and being developed, so expect **weekly / monthly** updates.
- We did not spend much time developing the frontend because we felt it was a waste of time compared to the **3726** lines of code
